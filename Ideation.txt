Recomp Health

1. Introduction
Recomp Health is a website that allows you to track your health data (workouts and meals). The goal is to provide a uniform place to understand your health trends.
By being able to track your workouts and meals, a user will have the data they need to make smarter decisions.

2. Expected List of Features
A brief list of features that you expect your website to support.
Brief justifications for including these features.

The website will initially have a homepage that describes the goals and idea behind the product.
Next will be a login section that will allow you to access your dashboard, that provides a summary of your past workouts and meals.
There will also be a section where you can input your workouts and meals each day, and retroactively. 
There will also be a section where you can set goals and track your progress against these goals.
Lastly, there will be a section where you can track yourself against other people in your area.

3. Market Survey
MyFitnessPal has a similar idea, but mapmyfitness does not provide the goal setting features as well as a dashboard.
Loseit has similar features, but not the same social aspect.
Fitocracy is social but lacks the data driven features we will include.
