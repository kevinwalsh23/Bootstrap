Bootstrap is designed to be mobile first, meaning that the classes are designed such that we can begin by targeting mobile device screens first and then work upwards to larger screen sizes. The starting point for this is first through media queries.
Support for Media queries <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
The viewport meta tag ensures that the screen width is set to the device width and the content is rendered with this width in mind.
